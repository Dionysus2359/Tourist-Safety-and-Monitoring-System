description: When asked to use shadcn components, fetch from the shadcn MCP server. Prefer full blocks when available.

Usage Rule
- When a task involves shadcn/ui (new component, variant, or block), FIRST call the shadcn MCP tool to get:
  1) canonical component or block source,
  2) usage notes, and
  3) any Tailwind/class variant guidance.
- Adapt styles to our tokens (no raw colors). Keep a11y states and focus rings.

Planning Rule
- During planning, explicitly list which shadcn components or blocks will be used and why.
- Prefer whole blocks (navbar, cards, dialogs) when suitable; otherwise compose primitives.

Implementation Rule
- Cite what you pulled from MCP in the plan. If a component is missing, pick the closest shadcn primitive and detail the delta.
